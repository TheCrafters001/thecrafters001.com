    <strong>Hello!</strong>
    Welcome, welcome! Don't mind the mess...<br>
    You must be wondering - &quot;Gosh, where have I ended up on the internet now?&quot; Well, let me tell you!<br>
    This is my little corner of the internet. Let me introduce myself!

    About Me
</h3>
<p>
    Hi! I am <strong>TheCrafters001</strong>! But I also can go by <strong>Craft</strong> or <strong>Crafters</strong>!
    I am a shy, friendly person in the world just trying to survive like everyone else. I am also a furry, a gamer, and self-taught programmer (still learning). Currently learning C&num;!<br>
    My absolute favorite game series is <a href="https://pokemon.com/">Pok&eacute;mon</a>! Pok&eacute;mon Black and White/Black 2 and White 2 being my favorite of them all! Other games 
    I enjoy also are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/440/Team_Fortress_2/">Team Fortress 2</a> (#FixTF2), <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/">Helldivers 2</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/72850/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim/">Skyrim</a>, <a href="https://www.suckerpunch.com/category/games/infamous/">inFAMOUS</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1716740/Starfield/">Starfield</a>, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/18725/Ori_The_Collection/">Ori</a> to name a few.

<h4>
    My Fursona - Bronze
</h4>
<p>
    You may or may not have seen my profile picture <span class="hidden-mobile">(most likely on the right side of the screen)</span> floating around online. That is of Bronze, my Fursona. He is a big, fluffy bee/moth <a href="https://synthspecies.com/" title="Synth Species Homepage">synth</a> hybrid.
    Want to learn more about him? I will slowly (but surely) be updating my website to include all of my characters. This, however, can take a while. Especially since all my characters are already on <a href="https://toyhou.se/TheCrafters001/characters">ToyHou.se</a>.
    If, for whatever reason, I finally did decide to actually start creating pages for them, you can see them <a href="/characters">here</a>!
