    My Fursona - Bronze

<p>
    You may or may not have seen my profile picture <span class="hidden-mobile">(most likely on the right side of the screen)</span> floating around online. That is of Bronze, my Fursona. He is a big, fluffy bee/moth <a href="https://synthspecies.com/" title="Synth Species Homepage">synth</a> hybrid.
    Want to learn more about him? What about some of my other characters? You can visit them over on <a href="https://toyhou.se/TheCrafters001/characters">ToyHou.se</a>!
