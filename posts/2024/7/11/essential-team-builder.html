<p>A little bit ago, I released the initial version of Essentials Team Builder (ETB) on GitHub and Eevee Expo. It isn&#39;t perfect, but it solves a personal pet peeve I have. I very much dislike the built-in editor to Essentials, and this tool pretty much aims to be that, but in a more user-friendly UI. With this upgrade from Showdown to Essentials Converter (StEC) comes a brand new UI, as well as a more optimized codebase. ETB uses a lot less code than what StEC did before, as initially, StEC had almost 2000 lines of code for JUST the code generation. With ETB, I compacted the generator into its own script which has just under 300 lines of code, and the calls it can receive can be done in as few as 1 line per entry!</p>
<p>On top of that, there also was a major code migration as during the initial development, StEC was using .NET Framework, but has since to moved to .NET, meaning it uses a more well structured code base, as well as taking up less space! And, on top of all of that, I managed to migrate it from version-to-version of Essentials, meaning I can handle Essentials 17, all the way up to 20+, and I can add more to it as needed! Though, the change between the 17 codebase, 18 codebase, and 19 codebase was so dramatic I might end up having to create new functions for newer versions as well... Ah well.</p>
<p>Oh, and the project is all open-source too! Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/TheCrafters001/essentials-team-builder" title="Essentials Team Builder GitHub Page">poke around the inner workings</a> of the program, and suggest fixes! Or, if you wish, the program now supports multiple languages, feel free to fork and open a <abbr title="Pull Request">PR</abbr> for your language!</p>
