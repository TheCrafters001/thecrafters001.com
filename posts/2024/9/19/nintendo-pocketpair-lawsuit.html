<p>Nintendo and The Pokémon Company has decided to throw a <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2024/240919.html">Patent lawsuit</a> at PocketPair, the developers of Palworld. Honestly, I understand why Nintendo would want to sue Palworld, as it uses mechanics akin to catching Pokémon, but outside of that, I feel like Palworld is a completely different game.</p>
<p>Palworld is quite fun in my opinion. It has interesting gameplay, and feels like its own thing compaired to Pokémon. I honestly don&#39;t think that Nintendo will win, however, I know dang well that they will try to fight that lawsuit to the end, giving PocketPair a lawyer nightmare&#39;s worth of paperwork and money thrown their way. Though, I find it interesting how Nintendo won&#39;t go after the countless other knock-offs that are on Steam as well, such as Temtem.</p>
<p>If PocketPair were to lose the lawsuit, I doubt that it would matter much honestly, I still feel like Palworld will hold some sort of presence now that it is out there. Weather or not Nintendo actually succeeds in their lawsuit ventures, I have no idea, but I feel like Palworld and PocketPair will stay around for a while.</p>
<p>As for the countless other controversies involving Palworld, I will not comment on, as I don&#39;t care about them much. I enjoy the game for what it is, and I don&#39;t want to feel bad for playing a game I enjoy. Plus, surrounding yourself in drama is not good for your mental health. Negativity is a bad thing, you know.</p>
