My Thoughts.</small><hr><img src="/asset/img/post-heros/nintendo-pocketpair-lawsuit.png" width="100%"><p>Nintendo and The Pokémon Company has decided to throw a <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2024/240919.html">Patent lawsuit</a> at PocketPair, the developers of Palworld. Honestly, I understand why Nintendo would want to sue Palworld, as it uses mechanics akin to catching Pokémon, but outside of that, I feel like Palworld is a completely different game.</p><p>Palworld is quite fun in my opinion. It has interesting gameplay, and feels like its own thing compaired to Pokémon. I honestly don&#39;t think that Nintendo will win, however, I know dang well that they will try to fight that lawsuit to the end, giving PocketPair a lawyer nightmare&#39;s worth of paperwork and money thrown their way. Though, I find it interesting how Nintendo won&#39;t go after the countless other knock-offs that are on Steam as well, such as Temtem.</p><p>If PocketPair were to lose the lawsuit, I doubt that it would matter much honestly, I still feel like Palworld will hold some sort of presence now that it is out there. Weather or not Nintendo actually succeeds in their lawsuit ventures, I have no idea, but I feel like Palworld and PocketPair will stay around for a while.</p><p>As for the countless other controversies involving Palworld, I will not comment on, as I don&#39;t care about them much. I enjoy the game for what it is, and I don&#39;t want to feel bad for playing a game I enjoy. Plus, surrounding yourself in drama is not good for your mental health. Negativity is a bad thing, you know.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="top-bar" colspan="6">Comments</td></tr><tr><td class="content-page correct-spacing" colspan="6"><script src="https://giscus.app/client.js" data-repo="TheCrafters001/thecrafters001.com" data-repo-id="R_kgDON3oKGQ" data-category="giscus" data-category-id="DIC_kwDON3oKGc4CoKVo" data-mapping="specific" data-term="So Nintendo Filed a Lawsuit Against PocketPair" data-strict="0" data-reactions-enabled="1" data-emit-metadata="0" data-input-position="top" data-theme="dark" data-lang="en" data-loading="lazy" crossorigin="anonymous" async></script><noscript><table style="max-width: 700px !important; margin-top: 15px;"><thead><tr><th class="top-bar">No script detected!</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="content-page">It looks like your browser is reporting that you have java-script disabled.
