If you didn't know, there is a new Pokémon game in the works over at GAME FREAK Inc.</p><p>Here is the trailer if you have not seen it already.</p><iframe src="https://youtube.com/embed/uq-Znr_jGIg"></iframe><p>I thought I would share what I think could be a possibility of what may come in the game. Do know, that I could be wrong, and I could be right. There really is no way for me to know what is coming.</p><h2>Present to Past</h2><p>Knowing the <a href="https://legends.arceus.pokemon.com/" title="Legends Arcues Home Page">last Legends game</a> took place thousands of years in the past, I think it is safe to assume the "Legends" part of the name means "Past." Knowing this, and what we know of <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/AZ" title="AZ - Bulbapedia">AZ</a> and the <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Ultimate_weapon" title="Ultimate weapon - Bulbapedia">Ultimate Weapon</a>, I think Legends Z-A will take place roughly 3,000 years in the past, either right after, or shortly after the War of Kalos. With the game serving as the "re-development" of Lumiose City, I think it is safe to say that Lumiose was destroyed during the war, and the player would have to go around the aftermath of the war, helping rebuild Lumiose. But, I also think that, while yes the game mainly takes place in the former Lumiose City ruins, you also get to explore some places just outside the area, such as Routes 4, 5, 13, 14 and 16. Maybe you may be able to explore some of the other places in Kalos, but I am unsure.</p><p>A friend of mine also mentioned that, since Lumiose is based on Paris, France, that there could be an area based off the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catacombs_of_Paris" title="Catacombs of Paris - Wikipedia">Catacombs of Paris</a>, which I feel would be an interesting inclusion if they did decide to add it. Could it be the resting place of People and Pokémon? Or perhapse something else?</p><h2>Long Lost Kingdom</h2><p>AZ used to be the king of Kalos, so what if we get to see AZ directly after the events of the firing of the Ultimate Weapon? I think it could be an interesting thing they could do, given that we do not know much about the Kingdom that AZ once ruled over. Which also leads me into my next theory, what if Lumiose City used to be AZ's Kingdom? If so, what caused the war? What was the war trying to achive? Why was AZ so compelled to turn a machine that could once bring those back to life, and potentialy making them immortal, and turning it into a weapon of mass distruction? What was AZ's goal as a leader?</p><p>The game is too far out to know, and with what little information we have, it is hard to know exactly what the game is about. But we also don't have a lot of answers as to what AZ's goal is. When we first meet him in X & Y, we learn of him being the king of Kalos, and that he had the key to the Ultimate Weapon, before <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Team_Flare" title="Team Flare - Bulbapedia">Team Flare</a> took it by force. After we learn about this, AZ tells the player the story of the Ultimate Weapon at Lysandre Labs.</p><blockquote cite="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/AZ#Quotes">Listen, one who will face Lysandre… A terribly long time ago… There was a man and a Pokémon. He loved that Pokémon very much. A war began. The man's beloved Pokémon took part in the war. Several years passed. He was given a tiny box. The man wanted to bring the Pokémon back. No matter what it took. The man built a machine to give it life. He brought his beloved Pokémon back. The man had suffered too much. His rage had not subsided. He could not forgive the world that had hurt the Pokémon he loved. He turned the machine into the ultimate weapon. The man became a bringer of destruction that ended the war. The Pokémon that was given life must have known… That the lives of many Pokémon were taken to restore its life. The resurrected Pokémon left the man. Get the key back. It should not be used. Everything will vanish again. Do you want to know unending pain…like I have?</blockquote><p>And at Geosenge Town.</p><blockquote cite="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/AZ#Quotes">A long time ago. A very long time ago. The man made an ultimate weapon. Using it required the life force of many Pokémon… The Pokémon granted eternal life learned this. The resurrected eternal Pokémon left the man's side. The man was surprised and sad. He had revived it so they could be together… Day after day passed, but they were never to meet. Eventually, he became a mere shell of a man. A man condemned to wander forever by the light of the weapon… And a Pokémon that also wanders eternally… Where is it now? What do I have to do to meet it?</blockquote><p>Beyond what he tells us nothing about the War, or his past life as a King.</p><h2>Closing thoughts</h2><p>All of these thoughts are just my personal thoughts or theories. I think it would be interesting to learn about the past of Kalos more, and to learn more about AZ, if at all. Of course, there is no way to know what we will get out of the game considering that it comes out in 2025, and GAME FREAK hasn't released much details to the public yet. Needless to say, I am excited for the new Legends game, and have higher than normal expectations for when it comes out! What do you think? I would like to hear yoru own opinions or thoughts on the upcoming game!</p><blockquote>Pokémon Legends: Z-A Logo by Game Freak.</blockquote></td></tr><tr><td class="top-bar" colspan="6">Comments</td></tr><tr><td class="content-page correct-spacing" colspan="6"><script src="https://giscus.app/client.js" data-repo="TheCrafters001/thecrafters001.com" data-repo-id="R_kgDON3oKGQ" data-category="giscus" data-category-id="DIC_kwDON3oKGc4CoKVo" data-mapping="specific" data-term="My Guesses for Pokémon Legends: Z-A" data-strict="0" data-reactions-enabled="1" data-emit-metadata="0" data-input-position="top" data-theme="light" data-lang="en" data-loading="lazy" crossorigin="anonymous" async></script></td></tr><tr><td colspan="6" class="footer">&copy; 2017<script>new Date().getFullYear()>2017&&document.write("-"+new Date().getFullYear());</script>, TheCrafters001. | <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy</a></td></tr></table><script data-goatcounter="https://stats.thecrafters001.com/count" async src="//gc.zgo.at/count.js"></script></body></html>
