                <small>Talking about the end of Retrospring</small>
                <hr>
                
<p>Retrospring, a way to ask questions to users for them to answer, is getting shut down on the 1st of March 2025. I used Retrospring to answer a few questions ask to me, whether it was from an anon user, or a user I knew, I tried to answer them. However, with the light of the closure of Retrospring in the future, I plan to find another way for others to ask questions to me. Right now, I have a pretty much fresh Tumblr account I don&#39;t use for much, I have opened up questions there, so if you want, you can ask me questions there for now. Here is the link: <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/new/ask/thecrafters001" title="Link to ask questions on Tumblr.">https://www.tumblr.com/new/ask/thecrafters001</a></p>
<p>Until Retrospring shuts down, my shortlink I made (<a href="https://thecrafters001.github.io/links/ask" title="Link to ask questions on Retrospring.">https://thecrafters001.github.io/links/ask</a>) will remain up. After the shutdown, however, it will be changed to link to this blog post, tumblr, or whatever other service I find. I know Tumblr isn&#39;t the best option, as you need to create an account, even to ask as anon, something Retrospring didn&#39;t require, so I will be looking for alternatives. I will update this blog post later if I do end up finding a new service and link that here.</p>
<p>Until then, you can keep asking me questions on Retrospring until the service gets shut down.</p>
