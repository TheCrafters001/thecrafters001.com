I have been wanting to expand my self-hosted web services. I am currently limited by hardware and storage, so I can't run anything like NextCloud (not for lots of storage at least, plus my self-host server tends to have a lot of instability right now that I am working on, which is why it has been going down lately), but I am looking for ideas. If anyone has any suggestions, let me know below!
