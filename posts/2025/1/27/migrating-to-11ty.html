    So yeah. I migrated to 11ty, since, as you can see, I am given greater control over how I want to make my website. It allows me to be more free by using my own HTML templates.
    For example, I can have my <a href="/pages.html">All Pages</a> template below, or even, my navigation bar at the top in the post here as well - Just as a few examples.
    Now does that mean I will include these on every page? No, not at all, given that it will sometimes break the site. But at least I have the freedom to do those things now.

{% include 'partial/pages/pages-main.html' %}
