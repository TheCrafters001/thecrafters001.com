    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have wanted to post thinges here for a long time that are kinda outside the realm of &amp;quot;blog&amp;quot; style posts. So I have decided to change this from &amp;quot;Blog&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Notebook&amp;quot; or something like that. At some point I will change the link in the navbar too to match the change, but right now I am gonna leave it as it is.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Migrating to 11ty</title>

    <id>https://thecrafters001.com/posts/2025/1/27/migrating-to-11ty/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So yeah. I migrated to 11ty, since, as you can see, I am given greater control over how I want to make my website. It allows me to be more free by using my own HTML templates. For example, I can have my &lt;a href=&quot;https://thecrafters001.com/pages.html&quot;&gt;All Pages&lt;/a&gt; template below, or even, my navigation bar at the top in the post here as well - Just as a few examples. Now does that mean I will include these on every page? No, not at all, given that it will sometimes break the site. But at least I have the freedom to do those things now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Main Pages&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table style=&quot;max-width: 700px !important;&quot;&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th class=&quot;top-bar&quot;&gt;Page Name&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th class=&quot;top-bar&quot;&gt;Page Link&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th class=&quot;top-bar&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;content-page&quot;&gt;Home&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;content-page&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thecrafters001.com/index.html&quot;&gt;/index.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;content-page&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;content-page&quot;&gt;Software&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;content-page&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thecrafters001.com/software/index.html&quot;&gt;/software/index.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;content-page&quot;&gt;I make programs!&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;content-page&quot;&gt;Games&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;content-page&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thecrafters001.com/games/index.html&quot;&gt;/games/index.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;content-page&quot;&gt;I make &quot;games&quot;!&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;content-page&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;content-page&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thecrafters001.com/blog/&quot;&gt;/blog/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;content-page&quot;&gt;I write things!&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;content-page&quot;&gt;PC Specs&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;content-page&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thecrafters001.com/pc-specs.html&quot;&gt;/pc-specs.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;content-page&quot;&gt;I do gaming!&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;content-page&quot;&gt;All Pages&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;content-page&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thecrafters001.com/pages.html&quot;&gt;/pages.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;content-page&quot;&gt;You are here.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content>

    <title>So Nintendo Filed a Lawsuit Against PocketPair</title>
    <link href="https://thecrafters001.com/posts/2024/9/19/nintendo-pocketpair-lawsuit/" />

    <id>https://thecrafters001.com/posts/2024/9/19/nintendo-pocketpair-lawsuit/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;img src=&quot;https://thecrafters001.com/asset/img/post-heros/nintendo-pocketpair-lawsuit.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nintendo and The Pokémon Company has decided to throw a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2024/240919.html&quot;&gt;Patent lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; at PocketPair, the developers of Palworld. Honestly, I understand why Nintendo would want to sue Palworld, as it uses mechanics akin to catching Pokémon, but outside of that, I feel like Palworld is a completely different game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palworld is quite fun in my opinion. It has interesting gameplay, and feels like its own thing compaired to Pokémon. I honestly don&amp;#39;t think that Nintendo will win, however, I know dang well that they will try to fight that lawsuit to the end, giving PocketPair a lawyer nightmare&amp;#39;s worth of paperwork and money thrown their way. Though, I find it interesting how Nintendo won&amp;#39;t go after the countless other knock-offs that are on Steam as well, such as Temtem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If PocketPair were to lose the lawsuit, I doubt that it would matter much honestly, I still feel like Palworld will hold some sort of presence now that it is out there. Weather or not Nintendo actually succeeds in their lawsuit ventures, I have no idea, but I feel like Palworld and PocketPair will stay around for a while.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the countless other controversies involving Palworld, I will not comment on, as I don&amp;#39;t care about them much. I enjoy the game for what it is, and I don&amp;#39;t want to feel bad for playing a game I enjoy. Plus, surrounding yourself in drama is not good for your mental health. Negativity is a bad thing, you know.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Retrospring - End of Life</title>
    <link href="https://thecrafters001.com/posts/2024/8/27/retrospring-eol/" />

    <id>https://thecrafters001.com/posts/2024/8/27/retrospring-eol/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Retrospring, a way to ask questions to users for them to answer, is getting shut down on the 1st of March 2025. I used Retrospring to answer a few questions ask to me, whether it was from an anon user, or a user I knew, I tried to answer them. However, with the light of the closure of Retrospring in the future, I plan to find another way for others to ask questions to me. Right now, I have a pretty much fresh Tumblr account I don&amp;#39;t use for much, I have opened up questions there, so if you want, you can ask me questions there for now. Here is the link: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tumblr.com/new/ask/thecrafters001&quot; title=&quot;Link to ask questions on Tumblr.&quot;&gt;https://www.tumblr.com/new/ask/thecrafters001&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until Retrospring shuts down, my shortlink I made (&lt;a href=&quot;https://thecrafters001.github.io/links/ask&quot; title=&quot;Link to ask questions on Retrospring.&quot;&gt;https://thecrafters001.github.io/links/ask&lt;/a&gt;) will remain up. After the shutdown, however, it will be changed to link to this blog post, tumblr, or whatever other service I find. I know Tumblr isn&amp;#39;t the best option, as you need to create an account, even to ask as anon, something Retrospring didn&amp;#39;t require, so I will be looking for alternatives. I will update this blog post later if I do end up finding a new service and link that here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until then, you can keep asking me questions on Retrospring until the service gets shut down.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Essentials Team Builder - Open-source Team Building</title>
    <link href="https://thecrafters001.com/posts/2024/7/11/essential-team-builder/" />
    <updated>2024-07-11T07:30:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://thecrafters001.com/posts/2024/7/11/essential-team-builder/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;img src=&quot;https://thecrafters001.com/asset/img/software/EssentialsTeamBuilder.png&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little bit ago, I released the initial version of Essentials Team Builder (ETB) on GitHub and Eevee Expo. It isn&amp;#39;t perfect, but it solves a personal pet peeve I have. I very much dislike the built-in editor to Essentials, and this tool pretty much aims to be that, but in a more user-friendly UI. With this upgrade from Showdown to Essentials Converter (StEC) comes a brand new UI, as well as a more optimized codebase. ETB uses a lot less code than what StEC did before, as initially, StEC had almost 2000 lines of code for JUST the code generation. With ETB, I compacted the generator into its own script which has just under 300 lines of code, and the calls it can receive can be done in as few as 1 line per entry!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of that, there also was a major code migration as during the initial development, StEC was using .NET Framework, but has since to moved to .NET, meaning it uses a more well structured code base, as well as taking up less space! And, on top of all of that, I managed to migrate it from version-to-version of Essentials, meaning I can handle Essentials 17, all the way up to 20+, and I can add more to it as needed! Though, the change between the 17 codebase, 18 codebase, and 19 codebase was so dramatic I might end up having to create new functions for newer versions as well... Ah well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, and the project is all open-source too! Feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/TheCrafters001/essentials-team-builder&quot; title=&quot;Essentials Team Builder GitHub Page&quot;&gt;poke around the inner workings&lt;/a&gt; of the program, and suggest fixes! Or, if you wish, the program now supports multiple languages, feel free to fork and open a &lt;abbr title=&quot;Pull Request&quot;&gt;PR&lt;/abbr&gt; for your language!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screenshot and Logo by TheCrafters001.

    <title>My Guesses for Pokémon Legends: Z-A</title>
    <link href="https://thecrafters001.com/posts/2024/5/8/pokemon-za-guesses/" />
    <updated>2024-05-09T00:31:29Z</updated>
    <id>https://thecrafters001.com/posts/2024/5/8/pokemon-za-guesses/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;img src=&quot;https://thecrafters001.com/asset/img/post-heros/pkmn-legends-za.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the up-coming Legends game in the Pokémon series, I thought that I may as well give some of my thoughts on it. If you didn&#39;t know, there is a new Pokémon game in the works over at GAME FREAK Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is the trailer if you have not seen it already.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://youtube.com/embed/uq-Znr_jGIg&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought I would share what I think could be a possibility of what may come in the game. Do know, that I could be wrong, and I could be right. There really is no way for me to know what is coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Present to Past&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://legends.arceus.pokemon.com/&quot; title=&quot;Legends Arcues Home Page&quot;&gt;last Legends game&lt;/a&gt; took place thousands of years in the past, I think it is safe to assume the &quot;Legends&quot; part of the name means &quot;Past.&quot; Knowing this, and what we know of &lt;a href=&quot;https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/AZ&quot; title=&quot;AZ - Bulbapedia&quot;&gt;AZ&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Ultimate_weapon&quot; title=&quot;Ultimate weapon - Bulbapedia&quot;&gt;Ultimate Weapon&lt;/a&gt;, I think Legends Z-A will take place roughly 3,000 years in the past, either right after, or shortly after the War of Kalos. With the game serving as the &quot;re-development&quot; of Lumiose City, I think it is safe to say that Lumiose was destroyed during the war, and the player would have to go around the aftermath of the war, helping rebuild Lumiose. But, I also think that, while yes the game mainly takes place in the former Lumiose City ruins, you also get to explore some places just outside the area, such as Routes 4, 5, 13, 14 and 16. Maybe you may be able to explore some of the other places in Kalos, but I am unsure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine also mentioned that, since Lumiose is based on Paris, France, that there could be an area based off the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catacombs_of_Paris&quot; title=&quot;Catacombs of Paris - Wikipedia&quot;&gt;Catacombs of Paris&lt;/a&gt;, which I feel would be an interesting inclusion if they did decide to add it. Could it be the resting place of People and Pokémon? Or perhapse something else?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Long Lost Kingdom&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;AZ used to be the king of Kalos, so what if we get to see AZ directly after the events of the firing of the Ultimate Weapon? I think it could be an interesting thing they could do, given that we do not know much about the Kingdom that AZ once ruled over. Which also leads me into my next theory, what if Lumiose City used to be AZ&#39;s Kingdom? If so, what caused the war? What was the war trying to achive? Why was AZ so compelled to turn a machine that could once bring those back to life, and potentialy making them immortal, and turning it into a weapon of mass distruction? What was AZ&#39;s goal as a leader?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game is too far out to know, and with what little information we have, it is hard to know exactly what the game is about. But we also don&#39;t have a lot of answers as to what AZ&#39;s goal is. When we first meet him in X &amp; Y, we learn of him being the king of Kalos, and that he had the key to the Ultimate Weapon, before &lt;a href=&quot;https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Team_Flare&quot; title=&quot;Team Flare - Bulbapedia&quot;&gt;Team Flare&lt;/a&gt; took it by force. After we learn about this, AZ tells the player the story of the Ultimate Weapon at Lysandre Labs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/AZ#Quotes&quot;&gt;Listen, one who will face Lysandre… A terribly long time ago… There was a man and a Pokémon. He loved that Pokémon very much. A war began. The man&#39;s beloved Pokémon took part in the war. Several years passed. He was given a tiny box. The man wanted to bring the Pokémon back. No matter what it took. The man built a machine to give it life. He brought his beloved Pokémon back. The man had suffered too much. His rage had not subsided. He could not forgive the world that had hurt the Pokémon he loved. He turned the machine into the ultimate weapon. The man became a bringer of destruction that ended the war. The Pokémon that was given life must have known… That the lives of many Pokémon were taken to restore its life. The resurrected Pokémon left the man. Get the key back. It should not be used. Everything will vanish again. Do you want to know unending pain…like I have?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And at Geosenge Town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/AZ#Quotes&quot;&gt;A long time ago. A very long time ago. The man made an ultimate weapon. Using it required the life force of many Pokémon… The Pokémon granted eternal life learned this. The resurrected eternal Pokémon left the man&#39;s side. The man was surprised and sad. He had revived it so they could be together… Day after day passed, but they were never to meet. Eventually, he became a mere shell of a man. A man condemned to wander forever by the light of the weapon… And a Pokémon that also wanders eternally… Where is it now? What do I have to do to meet it?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond what he tells us nothing about the War, or his past life as a King.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Closing thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of these thoughts are just my personal thoughts or theories. I think it would be interesting to learn about the past of Kalos more, and to learn more about AZ, if at all. Of course, there is no way to know what we will get out of the game considering that it comes out in 2025, and GAME FREAK hasn&#39;t released much details to the public yet. Needless to say, I am excited for the new Legends game, and have higher than normal expectations for when it comes out! What do you think? I would like to hear yoru own opinions or thoughts on the upcoming game!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Pokémon Legends: Z-A Logo by Game Freak.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content>
