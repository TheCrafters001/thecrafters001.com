From here-on-out, all my notes will be using <code class="language-markup">/notes/ </code> as the url instead of <code class="language-markup">/posts/ </code>.

An example of this is, this post is using <code class="language-markup">https://thecrafters001.com/notes/2025/7/31/updating-notes-url/ </code> while my last post was <code class="language-markup">https://thecrafters001.com/posts/2025/7/9/reverse-engineering-code/ </code>

All previous posts and notes will remain under <code class="language-markup">/posts/ </code>, this way, the links wont be broken. However, all new posts and notes will be under <code class="language-markup">/notes/ </code>. The RSS (ATOM) feed is still here: <a href="/notes/feed.xml"><button>RSS (ATOM) Feed</button></a>
