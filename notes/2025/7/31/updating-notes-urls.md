From here-on-out, all my notes will be using `/notes/` as the url instead of `/posts/`.

An example of this is, this post is using `https://thecrafters001.com/notes/2025/7/31/updating-notes-url/` while my last post was `https://thecrafters001.com/posts/2025/7/9/reverse-engineering-code/`

All previous posts and notes will remain under `/posts/`, this way, the links wont be broken. However, all new posts and notes will be under `/notes/`. The RSS (ATOM) feed is still here: <a href="/notes/feed.xml"><button>RSS (ATOM) Feed</button></a>
