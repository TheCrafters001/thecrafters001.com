I have went through and mostly fixed the code element on my site by replacing it with the [Prism](https://prismjs.com/) Javascript Syntex Highlighting. It works for the most part, but I am gonna have to go through and fix some of the ones I accidently left behind. If I left any behind, just let me know!
