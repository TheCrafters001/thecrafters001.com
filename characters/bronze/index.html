<p>Bronze is quite a nice and caring Synth. Though, people tend to be a little intimidated by how big he is. He usually likes to hang out in large, open spaces, as it seems that is where most people don't mind him.</p>
<hr>

<h3>Appearance</h3>
<p>Bronze is a Moth/Bee Hybrid. While his physical appearance is more moth-like, his colors show that he is part bee. Bronze is also quite tall, even for a Synth, at around 6'6".</p>
<hr>

<h3>Personality</h3>
<p>Bashful 》Bronze is really, really shy. To the point where he even has trouble talking to some of his existing friends.</p>
<p>Softy 》Despite his large, intimidating appearance, he is still quite gentle and can be a joy to be around once you get to know him.</p>
<hr>

<h3>Powers and Abilities</h3>
<p>He can fly, however not for long. The longest he has been able to fly is for about an hour, before he ends up crashing into the ground. His fly is also more of a hover than anything. Also, while he loves honey, he is unable to produce his own due to him being part moth.</p>
<p>He also has a stinger, however he doesn't like to show it unless he is relaxed, and around people that don't mind his stinger. And while he doesn't like using his stinger to hurt people, he can use it for self defence if he absolutly has to.</p>
<p>Due to the way his "blueprint" system was designed, he is able to rapidly change his form and appearance at will, often taking forms of other species of creatures. Even though in other forms, he may appear to be an organic life-form, he is still synthetic, making him as strong against attacks and damage as possible. The only indicator he is still a Synth in other forms is that his visor follows each form he takes. Think of him as a shapeshifter.</p>
